### Technical Stack ###:
Python, JavaScript, Django, HTML, and CSS

### Key Features: ### 
* Chatbot-based enrollment system for easier navigation, along with regular enrollment
* Language Localization feature supporting 8+ languages
* Feedback System able to send user feedback to the admin with anonymous sending features
* Email resource delivery upon successful enrollment
* Automated integration tests along with regular nightly build releases.

### My Role: ### I was primarily responsible for the creation of the feedback system. Utilized Django forms to implement the functionality. Users can report any bugs or issues they face, which would then be stored in the backend database for the admin to view. Users can also leave feedback anonymously without logging in, which is then stored as anonymous feedback.

### Why is the code private? : ### 
The source code is private due to academic integrity policies, but a functional walkthrough is provided above.
